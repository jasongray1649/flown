# FLOWN

A minimal programming language based on FLOW https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW_(programming_language)

Much less user friendly than the original, FLOWN is also Turing complete, as it operates on an infinite symbol tape (note: for implementation reasons it's more like a SIZE_MAX symbol tape).

There are five statements in FLOWN
```
IN
OUT
LEFT
RIGHT
IF
GO
```
